# Hi there 👋

## 🚀 About Me

🎓 I am Filipe Brito, a **Full Stack Developer** (specializing in **.NET Applications**). I graduated from Software Engineering in Waterloo, ON at Conestoga College.

🎸 Outside the world of tech too, I enjoy pushing myself to develop new skills. My hobbies range from **language learning**, **hiking**, **illustrating**, and **touch typing** to some whacky ones like **finding typos on signs**.

📚 I like reading books on **personal development**. My favorite one are **12 Rules for Life** by _Jordan Peterson_ in the genre of personal development, as it helped me a lot during difficult times in the past.

✈️ I love **traveling** too. I have been on solo trips to **France** in _2018_ and to **Argentina** in _2017_.
